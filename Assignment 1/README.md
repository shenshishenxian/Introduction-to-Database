Basic, “code” based data processing of structured data in files

– orders.csv, customers.csv 

Loads the data from the two files. Saves changed files when done.

Accepts a “database operation” for find or insert (from terminal/command line)
– “Find customer column1=value1, column7=value2”
– “Insert order (value1, value2,,value3,,,value4,,,,)”

Examples

– Find order employeeID=5, shipCountry=Brazil
– Insert customer ("ALFKI","Alfreds Futterkiste","Maria Anders","Sales Representative","Obere Str.57","Berlin","","12209","Germany","030-0074321","030-0076545")
